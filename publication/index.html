    Ad-hoc retrieval is an important problem with many practical applications. It forms the basis of web search, question-answering, and a new generation of virtual assistants being developed by several of the largest software companies in the world. In this report, we continue our exploration of the importance of multiple expressions of information needs. Our thesis is that over-reliance on a single query can lead to suboptimal performance, and that by creating multiple query representations for an information need and combining the relevance signals through fusion and relevance modeling, highly effective systems can be produced. This approach may form the basis for more complex multi-stage retrieval systems in a variety of applications.

  </h3>

  <div class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">
    
    Relevance modeling and data fusion are powerful yet simple approaches to improving the effectiveness of Information Retrieval Systems. For many of the classic TREC test collections, these approaches were used in many of the top performing retrieval systems. However, these approaches are often inefficient and are therefore rarely applied in production systems which must adhere to strict performance guarantees. Inspired by our recent work with human-derived query variations, we propose a new sampling-based system which provides significantly better efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs while leveraging both relevance modeling and data fusion. We show that our new end-to-end search system approaches the state-of-the-art in effectiveness while still being efficient in practice. Orthogonally, we also show how to leverage query expansion and data fusion to achieve significantly better risk-reward trade-offs than plain relevance modeling approaches.

  </h3>

  <div class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">
    
    Negated query terms allow documents containing such terms to be filtered out of a search results list, supporting disambiguation. In this work, the effect of negation on the efficiency of disjunctive, top-$k$ retrieval is examined. First, we show how negation can be integrated efficiently into two popular dynamic pruning algorithms. Then, we explore the efficiency of our approach, and show that while often efficient, negation can negatively impact the dynamic pruning effectiveness for certain queries.

  </h3>

  <div class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">
    
    Large scale retrieval systems often employ cascaded ranking architectures, in which an initial set of candidate documents are iteratively refined and re-ranked by increasingly sophisticated and expensive ranking models. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for predicting a range of performance-sensitive parameters based on minimizing end-to-end effectiveness loss. The framework does not require relevance judgments for training, is amenable to predicting a wide range of parameters, allows for fine tuned efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs, and can be easily deployed in large scale search systems with minimal overhead. As a proof of concept, we show that the framework can accurately predict a number of performance parameters on a query-by-query basis, allowing efficient and effective retrieval, while simultaneously minimizing the tail latency of an early-stage candidate generation system. On the $50$ million document ClueWeb09B collection, and across $25{,}000$ queries, our hybrid system can achieve superior early-stage efficiency to fixed parameter systems without loss of effectiveness, and allows more finely-grained efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs across the multiple stages of the retrieval system.

  </h3>

  <div class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">
    
    Score-at-a-Time index traversal is a query processing approach which supports early termination in order to balance efficiency and effectiveness trade-offs. In this work, we explore new techniques which extend a modern Score-at-a-Time traversal algorithm to allow for parallel postings traversal. We show that careful integration of parallel traversal can improve both efficiency and effectiveness when compared with current single threaded early termination approaches. In addition, we explore the various trade-offs for differing early termination heuristics, and propose hybrid systems which parallelize long running queries, while processing short running queries with only a single thread.

  <div class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">
    
    Furthering the state-of-the-art in adhoc web search is one of the underlying goals for the NTCIR We Want Web (WWW) task. Adhoc search can be viewed as a bridge connecting many of the specialized sub-fields that are a result of the way people connect to and use information access systems. Since this is the first year of the WWW task, and no training data was provided for the English subtask, we focused on classic techniques for improving effectiveness in lieu of modern techniques based on supervised learning. In particular, we explored the use of Markov Random Field Models (MRFs), static document features, field-based weighting, and query expansion. This round we made extensive use of the Indri search system and the flexible query language it provides to produce effective results.

    The 2017 TREC CORE Track is a re-run of the classic TREC ad hoc search evaluation campaign, with the vision of establishing new methodologies for creating IR test collections. The previous TREC newswire ad hoc task was the 2004 Robust Track, where the emphasis was on improving the effectiveness of poorly performing topics in previous tracks. The TREC CORE 2017 track reuses the Robust 2004 topic set, for the development of relevance judgments over a new New York Times corpus, composed of newswire articles published between 1987 and 2007. For this task, RMIT contributed three different runs, including two manual, and one automatic run.

  </h3>

  <div class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">
    
    With the growing popularity of the world-wide-web and the increasing accessibility of smart devices, data is being generated at a faster rate than ever before. This presents scalability challenges to web-scale search systems – how can we efficiently index, store and retrieve such a vast amount of data? A large amount of prior research has attempted to address many facets of this question, with the invention of a range of efficient index storage and retrieval frameworks that are able to efficiently answer most queries. However, the current literature generally focuses on improving the mean or median query processing time in a given system. In the proposed PhD project, we focus on improving the efficiency of high percentile tail latencies in large scale IR systems while minimising end-to-end effectiveness loss. Although there is a wealth of prior research involving improving the efficiency of large scale IR systems, the most relevant prior work involves predicting long-running queries and processing them in various ways to avoid large query processing times. Prediction is often done through pre-trained models based on both static and dynamic features from queries and documents. Many different approaches to reducing the processing time of long running queries have been proposed, including parallelising queries that are predicted to run slowly, scheduling queries based on their predicted run time, and selecting or modifying the query processing algorithm depending on the load of the system. Considering the specific focus on tail latencies in large-scale IR systems, the proposed research aims to: (i) study what causes large tail latencies to occur in large-scale web search systems, (ii) propose a framework to mitigate tail latencies in multi-stage retrieval through the prediction of a vast range of query-specific efficiency parameters, (iii) experiment with mixed-mode query semantics to provide efficient and effective querying to reduce tail latencies, and (iv) propose a time-bounded solution for Document-at-a-Time (DaaT) query processing which is suitable for current web search systems. As a preliminary study, Crane et al. compared some state-of-the-art query processing strategies across many modern collections. They found that although modern DaaT dynamic pruning strategies are very efficient for ranked disjunctive processing, they have a much larger variance in processing times than Score-at-a-Time (SaaT) strategies which have a similar efficiency profile regardless of query length or the size of the required result set. Furthermore, Mackenzie et al. explored the efficiency trade-offs for paragraph retrieval in a multi-stage question answering system. They found that DaaT dynamic pruning strategies could efficiently retrieve the top-1,000 candidate paragraphs for very long queries. Extending on prior work, Mackenzie et al. showed how a range of per-query efficiency settings can be accurately predicted such that $99.99$ percent of queries are serviced in less than $200$ ms without noticeable effectiveness loss. In addition, a reference list framework was used for training models such that no relevance judgements or annotations were required. Future work will focus on improving the candidate generation stage in large-scale multi-stage retrieval systems. This will include further exploration of index layouts, traversal strategies, and query rewriting, with the aim of improving early stage efficiency to reduce the system tail latency, while potentially improving end-to-end effectiveness.

  </h3>

  <div class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">
    
    We present an empirical comparison between document-at-a-time (DaaT) and score-at-a-time (SaaT) document ranking strategies within a common framework. Although both strategies have been extensively explored, the literature lacks a fair, direct comparison: such a study has been difficult due to vastly different query evaluation mechanics and index organizations. Our work controls for score quantization, document processing, compression, implementation language, implementation effort, and a number of details, arriving at an empirical evaluation that fairly characterizes the performance of three specific techniques: WAND (DaaT), BMW (DaaT), and JASS (SaaT). Experiments reveal a number of interesting findings. The performance gap between WAND and BMW is not as clear as the literature suggests, and both methods are susceptible to tail queries that may take orders of magnitude longer than the median query to execute. Surprisingly, approximate query evaluation in WAND and BMW does not significantly reduce the risk of these tail queries. Overall, JASS is slightly slower than either WAND or BMW, but exhibits much lower variance in query latencies and is much less susceptible to tail query effects. Furthermore, JASS query latency is not particularly sensitive to the retrieval depth, making it an appealing solution for performance-sensitive applications where bounds on query latencies are desirable.

    This paper describes the four systems RMIT fielded for the TREC 2016 LiveQA task and the associated experiments. Similar to last year, the results show that simple solutions tend to work best, and that our improved baseline systems achieved an above-average performance. We use a commercial search engine as a first stage retrieval mechanism and compare it with our internal system which uses a carefully curated document collection. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that on average the small curated collection performed better within our current framework, warranting further studies on when and when not to use an external resource, such as a publicly available search engine API. Finally, we show that small improvements to performance can substantially reduce failure rates.

  </h3>

    Mobile search is quickly becoming the most common mode of search on the internet. This shift is driving changes in user behaviour, and search engine behaviour. Just over half of all search queries from mobile devices have local intent, making location-aware search an increasingly important problem. In this work, we compare the efficiency and effectiveness of two general types of geographical search queries, range queries and $k$-nearest-neighbor queries, for common web search tasks. We test state-of-the-art spatial-textual indexing and search algorithms for both query types on two large datasets. Finally, we present a rank-safe dynamic pruning algorithm that is simple to implement and use with current inverted indexing techniques. Our algorithm is more efficient than the tightly coupled best-in-breed hybrid indexing algorithms that are commonly used for top-$k$ spatial textual queries, and more likely to find relevant documents than techniques derived from range queries.

    With GPS data becoming commonplace through smartphones and other such devices, the need to support systems that are location-aware continues to increase. Just over half of all search queries from mobile devices have local intent, making location-aware search an increasingly important problem. Traditional Information Retrieval systems are able to return documents based on keywords, but this is insufficient for geographically motivated search tasks. This thesis investigates the efficiency and effectiveness trade-offs between two general types of geographical search queries, range queries and $k$-nearest-neighbour queries, for common web search tasks.  We test and analyse state-of-the-art spatial-textual indexing and search algorithms for both query types across two large datasets.  Finally, a rank-safe dynamic pruning algorithm is presented, which is shown to outperform the current tightly-coupled indexes used for top-$k$ location-aware queries
